Cloud Gaming Platform Project (CGdubP)

Overview

The Cloud Gaming Platform Project (CGdubP) is an advanced cloud-based infrastructure designed to deliver an optimal gaming experience for Black Myth: Wukong. The project is a testament to the power and flexibility of cloud computing, leveraging Terraform for automated infrastructure deployment on AWS.

Project Scope

This platform is built to handle the complexities of cloud-based gaming, including but not limited to:

High-Performance VPC Configuration: Secure and scalable Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) setup to ensure low-latency gaming.

Optimized Subnets: Strategically placed subnets within the VPC to maximize efficiency and performance.

Secure IAM Roles: Implementation of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to ensure a secure environment.

Terraform Automation: Use of Terraform to automate the deployment and management of cloud infrastructure, enabling a repeatable and efficient setup process.

Motivation

As a cloud engineer and casual gamer, I created CGdubP to merge my passion for cloud technology with my love for gaming. The goal is to craft an environment that can fully harness the capabilities of cloud computing to provide the best possible gaming experience, specifically for Black Myth: Wukong.
