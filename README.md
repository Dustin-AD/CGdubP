Cloud Gaming Platform Project (CGdubP)

Overview

The Cloud Gaming Platform Project (CGdubP) is an advanced cloud-based infrastructure designed to deliver an optimal gaming experience for Black Myth: Wukong. The project is a testament to the power and flexibility of cloud computing, leveraging Terraform for automated infrastructure deployment on AWS.

Project Scope

This platform is built to handle the complexities of cloud-based gaming, including but not limited to:

High-Performance VPC Configuration: Secure and scalable Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) setup to ensure low-latency gaming.

Optimized Subnets: Strategically placed subnets within the VPC to maximize efficiency and performance.

Secure IAM Roles: Implementation of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles to ensure a secure environment.

Terraform Automation: Use of Terraform to automate the deployment and management of cloud infrastructure, enabling a repeatable and efficient setup process.

Motivation

As a cloud engineer and casual gamer, I created CGdubP to merge my passion for cloud technology with my love for gaming. The goal is to craft an environment that can fully harness the capabilities of cloud computing to provide the best possible gaming experience, specifically for Black Myth: Wukong.

Features

Automated Infrastructure: Deployment and management of the entire infrastructure are automated using Terraform, ensuring a consistent and reliable environment.

Scalable Architecture: Designed to scale based on demand, ensuring optimal performance even during high traffic.

Security-First Design: Robust security measures implemented at every level, from IAM roles to VPC security groups.

Performance Optimization: Infrastructure tuned for the highest possible performance, with an emphasis on low latency and high throughput.


Instructions for Safely Setting Up Your Own Environment

Follow these steps to securely set up your cloud gaming infrastructure using the CGdubP project. 
Make sure you handle sensitive data carefully by following the best practices outlined below.

1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the public repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/cgdubp-infrastructure.git
cd cgdubp-infrastructure

2. Install Terraform
If you don’t have Terraform installed, you can download it from here.

Verify the installation with:

terraform --version

3. Set Up Your AWS Credentials
You'll need valid AWS credentials to interact with AWS resources. Configure AWS credentials in one of the following ways:

Use the AWS CLI:

aws configure

OR

Set environment variables:

export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
Do not hardcode your credentials in the Terraform files.

4. Create a terraform.tfvars File (Securely)
The terraform.tfvars file stores sensitive information like your database credentials and SSH key names. This file should not be committed to version control. To create one:

touch terraform.tfvars

Inside the terraform.tfvars file, add the following configuration:

vpc_name    = "your_vpc_name"
local_ip    = "your_local_ip"
key_name    = "your_ssh_key_name"
db_username = "your_db_username"
db_password = "your_db_password"
vpc_name: A custom name for your VPC.
local_ip: Your public IP address to allow access to your EC2 instance.
key_name: The name of your SSH key (this must already exist in AWS).
db_username: A username for your PostgreSQL database.
db_password: A secure password for your PostgreSQL database.

5. Initialize Terraform
Once you’ve set up your credentials and variables, initialize Terraform to download the necessary providers and modules:

terraform init

6. Run a Terraform Plan
Run a Terraform plan to preview the infrastructure that will be created. This step helps you confirm everything is configured correctly before applying changes:

terraform plan

7. Apply the Terraform Configuration
To create the infrastructure, run the following command. Terraform will ask for confirmation before applying the changes:

terraform apply
Type yes when prompted to confirm the infrastructure creation.

8. Access the EC2 GPU Instance
Once the infrastructure has been created, you can SSH into the EC2 instance using your SSH key:

ssh -i path/to/your-ssh-key.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-public-ip
Replace your-ec2-public-ip with the actual public IP address of your EC2 instance (you can find this in the Terraform outputs).

9. Monitor Your Infrastructure
For security and maintenance, make sure to set up monitoring and logging using AWS CloudWatch and AWS CloudTrail. This ensures you have visibility into resource usage and potential security issues.

10. Clean Up Resources
When you are done, make sure to clean up your environment to avoid unnecessary charges. Use the following command to destroy all infrastructure created by Terraform:

terraform destroy

Security Best Practices

Keep your terraform.tfvars file private: Never commit this file to version control. It contains sensitive data like your database password and SSH key name.

Use IAM roles: Ensure your EC2 instances have appropriate IAM roles with the least privilege to access necessary AWS services.

Restrict access: Use Security Groups to restrict access to your EC2 instance and RDS database to trusted IP addresses only.

Enable encryption: Ensure encryption at rest is enabled for your RDS database and DynamoDB. Terraform is configured to enable this by default.

By following these steps and applying the best practices, you can securely set up your own cloud gaming environment.

If you run into any issues or have questions, feel free to open an issue in the GitHub repo!
